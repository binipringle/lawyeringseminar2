Under Section 1012 of the Family Court Act, a respondent parent may be responsible for neglect if the parent has been the victim of domestic violence and the child has been exposed to that violence, if (1) the child’s physical, mental or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as a result of the failure of the parent to exercise a minimum degree of care, or (2) to provide the child with proper supervision or guardianship, by unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm, or a substantial risk thereof. N.Y. Family Ct. Act § 1012 (f) (i), (f) (B).  Imminent danger must be near or impending and there must be a link or causal connection between the basis for the neglect petition and the circumstances that allegedly produce the child’s impairment or imminent danger of impairment, including impairment to the child’s emotional or mental health or condition. Nicholson v. Scopetta 3 N.Y.3d 357 (2004), 370. When the respondent parent is a battered mother, courts have found that the “minimum degree of care” required to be exercised by the parent is dependent on the severity and frequency of the violence and the resources and the options available to her. Id., 371.
