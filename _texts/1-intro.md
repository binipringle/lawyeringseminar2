COURSE DESCRIPTION

On a daily and long-term basis, individuals make promises and agreements with other individuals, groups, and various entities. American contract law attempts to address a range of questions regarding when the courts will enforce these promises or agreements. These questions include whether an enforceable agreement has been reached; what policies are at stake; what are the limits of enforcement; how do we interpret the meaning of the words or actions of the agreement; and what remedies are available when a contract is breached.

The development of contract law's "answers" to these questions reflects competing visions of community and underlying policy choices. We will explore these "answers" (contract law rules), the underlying principles and arguments advanced to support these rules, and a range of normative visions, often implicit, that shape contract doctrine and practice.  In our study of contract law, we will also examine the role of market ideology, and perspectives on race, gender, class, sexuality, and culture that are imbedded in law "texts," and the legal decision-making processes.  We will also explore the various roles that lawyers play in creating, implementing or interpreting these agreements.
LME will focus on three specific teaching and learning objectives:

a.  Understanding basic contract law doctrines with attention to critical theoretical frameworks and lawyering issues;
b.  Developing academic skills (case briefing, note taking, outlining, and oral communication) and legal reasoning skills (working with facts, working with rules, issue spotting, legal and policy analysis); and
	c.  Developing effective organization and time management.

GRADING
1.	Midterm Exam (15%)	(March 17, 2021) (15 multiple choice questions)
2.	Final Examination (73%) (I will announce the format in class)
3.	Ungraded Practice Hypos (12% total, 4 points each)


Practice Hypos: I will assign four practice hypos during the course of the semester. You must complete three of them for credit (four points each), and submit them to the appropriate Skills drop box by the specified due date (tbd). You can choose which three practice hypos to submit for credit. The assignments won’t be graded -- in order to receive credit, you will need to make a good faith effort, as determined by me based on the recommendation of Professor Mott. Your answers should be written in IRAC format, and you should apply policy and theory as appropriate. I will post a sample answer for each practice hypo on TWEN after the due date, and you will get individualized feedback from the Skills Center or the TA on each hypo you turn in. If you complete the fourth practice hypo, you will receive two points extra credit added to your total points for the class.


COURSE INFORMATION

Pronoun/Name Statement.  I will gladly honor your request to address you by a preferred name or gender pronoun that varies from what I receive from the registrar.  Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I can make appropriate changes to my records.

In this course, you will be graded specifically on the merits of your work.  Your grade will not be compromised in any regard if you take a position that is not popular, or if you intellectually challenge me or other students in a respectful manner and in a way that is well reasoned and supported.

Class Recordings.  I will record each class on Zoom and post on TWEN.  You are not permitted to record class or take any screen shots of the class unless you obtain advance permission from the professor.

Email and TWEN Class Site.  You are expected to regularly check your CUNY email and the class site on TWEN.  Both tools will be used to communicate with the class, update schedules and assignments, post reading materials, and convey other important information.  

I encourage you to use Forums on TWEN for general questions about the class because your classmates may have the same questions. You are also encouraged to use Forums to post interesting articles or materials you may come across that relate to the readings. I often will use Forums to provide a space for conversations that we may not have time in class to cover.

DOCTRINAL FOCUS	 READING ASSIGNMENT
“RST” = Restatement (Second) of Contracts in Appendix of Textbook.	SKILLS FOCUS AND THOUGHT QUESTIONS
1

I.  INTRODUCTION TO CONTRACT LAW

     The Bargain Principle

-  Kirksey v. Kirksey


Text pp 18-20 (up to “facts”; 23-24 (through first paragraph); 27-40.  

RST § 1

Consider: Problem posted on TWEN (What promises should the law enforce?)


Outlining

After class, using the syllabus, create a skeletal outline of the course.  Compare this to the table of contents and your notes from today’s class discussion, looking for any detail that the table of contents or class notes might add to the topics from the syllabus. This will be the start of your course outline, which you should fill in yourself throughout the semester as we complete our coverage of different doctrines.

Theoretical Perspective

The reading and class discussion will introduce the role of theoretical perspective in contract law and specifically the theoretical perspectives of Neo-Classical Economic Theory and Socioeconomic Theory.
2

II. OBJECTIVITY: INTERPRETING COMMUNICATIVE ACTS/WORDS

	The Objective Theory of       	Interpretation

- Embry v. Hargadine, McKittrick Dry Goods Co.

- R.L.M. Dist. Co. v. W.A. Taylor, Inc.





Text pp 59-66, 82-87



Working with Rules: Policy

What is the difference between the objective and subjective approaches to assent? Why, as a policy matter, does contract law opt for the objective approach?

Case Briefing

Brief Embry for class.  I will post a sample brief on TWEN with a discussion of the choices that the author of the sample brief made.  Consider the differences between yours and the sample and the likely reasons for the differences.   

3

III. CONTRACT FORMATION: ASSENT

A. Was there an Offer?

-	Leonard v. Pepsico

-	Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus (discussed in Pepsi)

-	Carbolic Smoke Ball (discussed in Pepsi)


Text pp 87-88, 95-107 (top)

RST § 24

Working with Rules: Inferring Factors

What facts did the Pepsico court consider important in determining whether an offer had been made?  

Based on the court’s holding, use those facts to construct a rule that future courts can use to determine whether there was an offer.  

How does the rule on ads (and the exceptions thereto) fit within the rules on offer generally?

Working with Rules: Policy

What justifies the general rule on ads and offers? What justifies the exceptions? Whom do these rules protect and against what?

Outlining

Write a synthesized rule statement for offer.  

4

B.  Was there Acceptance?

Mirror Image Rule and the Mode/ Manner of Acceptance

- Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. v. Smith

- Russell v. Texas Co.


Judicial Interpretation of Unread Boilerplate, Shrink Wrap, Click Wrap, and Browse Wrap Contracts

- Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc.

Text pp 107-112, 114 (starting at “acceptance by silence”)-116 (top), 126-127 (stop at the case)


RST § 30

UCC §§ 2-206, 2-207(1)


Text pp 116-127 (very top)


Working with Rules: Sources of Law and Theoretical Perspective

In class, we will discuss Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as a source of authority of contract law.  How does the UCC differ from the RST in terms of its authority and scope?

Read UCC §§ 2-206 & 2-207(1).  Would Panhandle have been decided differently if it had been a sale of goods and subject to Article 2 of the UCC?  If so, how?

What justifies the common law mirror image rule? Under what circumstances does this rule protect the offeror?  Under what circumstance might it create incentives for opportunistic behavior?  Why does the UCC reject the mirror image rule? Generally speaking, is the UCC rule more generous to offerors or offerees?

In class, we will discuss the contrast between Formalism and Legal Realism as illustrated by the difference between the RST and the UCC.
5

	C.  Revocation of the Offer Prior to Acceptance: Unilateral Contracts, Option Contacts and Firm Offers

- Dickinson v. Dodds

- Drennan v. Star Paving Co.

Text pp 155-159, 161-168 (top)

RST §§ 25, 45, 87


6

IV. CONTRACT FORMATION: CONSIDERATION

A.     The Origins and Elements of the Consideration Doctrine: “Legal Detriment” and “Bargained-For”

- Hamer v. Sidway

- U.S. v. Betty Jo Meadors 	




Text pp 185-205 (top)

Read the text of RST § 71 and all the comments and illustrations carefully.





Theoretical Perspective: Neo-Classical Economic Theory

It is said that courts won’t look at the adequacy or fairness of the consideration. Should sellers be permitted to charge what the market will bear in all cases?  What if that means charging higher prices for goods in poor neighborhoods?  What if it means charging women more than men or BIPOC consumers more than white consumers? Should it matter if members of those groups agree to pay more?

7

B.    Applications of the Consideration Doctrine: Gift with a Condition, Nominal Consideration, the Pre-Existing Duty Rule, and Illusory Promises

- Langer v. Superior Steel Corp.

- White v. Village of Homewood Fire and Police Commission

- Wood v. Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon

To use as a practice problem outside of class:

- Lawrence v. Ingham Country Health Department Family Planning






Text pp 205-214 (bottom), 218-219














Text pp 220-226





Theoretical Perspective and Close Case Reading

What is the “primitive stage of formalism” that the Wood court is rejecting? Why is it being rejected?

What is Cardozo telling us about the relationship between the parties in the case? For whose benefit is the term implied?  Who was vulnerable under the contract as written?



Theoretical Perspective: Critical Legal Theory

The Paula Childress story beginning on p 226 is optional reading. It provides an account of the role of class, race, and poverty in the dehumanization of people who are poor. Does this attitude help explain the devaluation of the claim in the Lawrence case?

Would the outcome of Lawrence change if Ethel Lawrence had been a paying patient? What does this tell you about who is the least protected by the consideration doctrine?

What would have been a more persuasive way for the clinic to make the case that there was no consideration in Lawrence?


8

V. ALTERNATIVES TO THE BARGAIN MODEL

	A. The Reliance principle: Promissory Estoppel

       - Ricketts v. Scothorn

        The Promise

9

B.  The Restitution Principle

-	Cotnam v. Wisdom

-	Bailey v. West

-	Toalson v. Arch Madison

Text pp 46-53, 292-303


Outlining

Consider what each case adds to your understanding of the doctrine of Restitution.  Consider the role the cases will ultimately play in your outline of Restitution.
10

VI.  CONTRACT FORMATION: STATUTE OF FRAUDS

A.	When is a Writing Necessary?

-  Metz Beverage Co. v. Wyoming Beverages, Inc.


Text pp 320-327

Consider: SOF Problems posted on TWEN 	











DOCTRINAL FOCUS	READING
ASSIGNMENT	SKILLS FOCUS AND THOUGHT QUESTIONS
11

VII. DEFENSES: EXPLICIT POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MORAL CONTROLS ON CONTRACTING

 A.  Public Policy

     -  In the Matter of Baby “M"  (Superior court and supreme court opinions)


Text pp 319, 333-350

RST § 178


Optional reading: Two articles about surrogacy posted on TWEN under “Course Materials”

Consider: Baby M drafting exercise (posted under “class exercises”)

Make a list of policies for and against enforcing the Baby M contract (including the arguments from the case and the other readings).  Factors both favoring and disfavoring enforcement should include contract / law and economic arguments as well as social policy arguments.  	

Working with Facts

Consider the language the lower court used in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns.  What differences are evident in tone and word choice? What language does the appellate court use in characterizing the Whiteheads and the Sterns?  Are there similar differences in tone and word choice?

Consider the role that these choices play in the process of legal analysis and the courts’ decisions.  How do these choices inform your reading of the case?

Theoretical Perspective

Consider any discomfort you may have with either the lower court or the appellate opinion.  Can you categorize your objection in terms of one or more of the theories we studied?

12

 B.  Lack of Capacity: Who Can Contract?

-	Paula Darlene Hampton v. Dillard Dept. Stores

1.	Children

-	Kim Young v. Phillip Weaver


 2. Mental Incapacity

Legal tests
(volitional and cognitive)


Text pp 350-368 (very top), 372

RST §§ 12, 14, & 15

Working with Rules: The Role of Policy in the Rule

Do you think the rule for minority is fair? Whom is the rule trying to protect and from what?  What assumptions does the rule make about minors? Are these assumptions valid?  How are those assumptions challenged empirically by the readings?

Working with Rules: The Role of Policy in the Rule

How is the test for mental capacity different from the test for minority? Why do you suppose the tests are different?  By comparing these rules, we can see that policy is built into each rule. What policy concerns underlie the different rules?

13

 C. Duress: Force and Threats

-  Trane v. Bond





























Text pp 440-452

RST §§ 174 - 176




























Working with Rules: Articulating and Elementizing a Rule

What’s the difference between     § 174 and § 175 in substance and in effect?  What elements are required under § 175(1) for a showing of duress by threat by the other party?  Read § 176.  When is a threat improper?  When might a threat be proper?


Note Taking and Outlining

With your study group, prepare answers to the questions about duress posted on TWEN under “Class Exercises.” You should be able to answer these questions from your notes, and some of the questions might help you in the process of converting your notes into an outline.


14

 D. Miscommunication

   - Mutual Mistake
   - Unilateral Mistake
   - Mistake in Expression

-	First Baptist Church v. Barber Contracting

 E.  Misunderstanding

15

 F.  Misrepresentation: False Statements, Duty to Read and Duty to Disclose

-  Kang v. Harrington

-  Vokes v. Arthur Murray, Inc.











Text pp 405-411, 419-428

RST §§ 164, 159-172

Working with Rules:  Elementizing

What are the four elements required for a showing of misrepresentation?  Use §§159-172 to fill in the rules and definitions for each of the four elements.
















Theoretical Perspective

Consider background assumptions the court may have made about women and widows in Vokes.  What role do you think Vokes’s
gender played in the court’s reasoning? What role do you think race, class, or gender should play in analyzing a party’s behavior? We will use this case and these theoretical issues as the basis of a discussion on competing economic theories about the appropriate role of these characteristics in legal reasoning.
16

G. Unconscionability:  Procedural and Substantive Bargaining Defects

-  Williams v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co.



Text pp 459-472

Consider: Walker Thomas exercise (posted under “class exercises)

UCC § 2-302

RST § 208

Working with Rules

What is the difference between the doctrines of void as against public policy and unconscionability?

Issue Spotting

Consider any other contract defenses that might have been available to Williams.  What key fact or facts are necessary to implicate each of those possible defenses?

17

 A.  Impracticability




 B.  Agreed Modifications

-  Alaska Packers’ Ass’n v. Domenico et al.

-  Quigley v. Wilson






Text pp 485-486, 493, 497 (note)

Consider: Alaska Packers drafting exercise (posted under “class exercises”)

UCC § 2-209

RST § 89

Practice Point: Drafting

Draft a modification to the Alaska Packers contract that would be more immune to challenge.  












Theoretical Perspective:  Neo-Classical Economics and Socioeconomics

What neo-classical economic assumptions does the court make in Alaska Packers that may have influenced the outcome of the case?  How might you challenge those assumptions?

-  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. v. H.W. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.







Text pp 527-541, 562 (“Note”)

UCC §§1-201(3), (11), (19) & (20), §§ 1-203, 1-205, 1-208,  2-306

RST §§ 205, 219-223




Text pp 587-590, 593-597

UCC § 201-203, 206-207





Theoretical Perspective: Formalism and Legal Realism

Was Nanakuli decided from a Formalist / Classical Contract Law perspective or a Legal Realist perspective? What clues does the court give of its theoretical perspective? How might the outcome have changed had the judge adopted a different theoretical perspective?

What about Pacific Gas?




19

-  Betaco, Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co.


Text pp 568-580

UCC § 2-202

20

X. BREACH OF CONTRACT

A. Constructive Conditions and Substantial Performance

-  Jacob & Youngs, Inc. v. Kent

Text pp 615-627, 653-54

Text pp 720-722

RST § 351

Text pp 725-733

Working with Rules: Identifying Rule Structures

Locate the rule for foreseeability in Hadley.  What is the rule structure of that rule? Now read RST § 351.  Describe the similarities and differences between the two rules.  Identify the overall rule structure for foreseeability.
What is the difference between the two kinds of cases described in Hadley (“ordinary” and “special” circumstances cases)? Which kind of case is Hadley?
Theoretical Perspective:  Feminist Legal Theory

Consider what role, if any, you think gender played in Parker.
