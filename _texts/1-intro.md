Notes

Rule statement. Neglect. Think of policy. Think of theme.

Start reading cases with my argument in mind.

Rule explanation

Rule will be explained by including (in no parrtiicular order)

Policy
Burden of proof
what imminent means
what standard is femdoc
what minimum degree means (not best not maximum)

read ccase thatt sccares me most - where i think thhey hahve most argument - and prepare argument my ccase is not like that - this distinguishes my cccase

Would a reasonable parent in this position have done things differently than Luisa Russo? you would paint the initial babysittiing as reasonable and careing - the pandemic ccame and sccrewed up herr life and got iin the way of her best laiiid plans to caare for her cchildren and pushed her into a posiitioin - she tried to do this (having nadine take care of children) but couldnt - had to keep kids aways from nadiines parents - that blew up that plan - so she came up with another safety plan - older kid take care of younger - qfs might paint the parrent as someone who had to come over life in a pandemic - doesnt obviate neglect but shows the parent in a liight of someone who was reasonable - a parent in a pandemic who triied to care for herrr cchildren -  

annotated affidavit

what part of the requirements ... see slide

what storrry am i telliing - write three or four sentence story of - show that luisa was ccareful and tried to make surre her children would be safe -

organize facts in affiidaviit to address aspects of rule/rule explanation (policcy definitiions examples standards) of neglect

key facts are had her phone number - heard screaming behind door - luisa told her sth - carrmela is kiind of wiild and creative and breaks things - would she hhave a sense of how carmela was because she babysat

provide background iinformation supporting narratiive - showingg why W was in a positoin to know the "facts" contained in (1) above

Asia McClain affidavit - it is the affidavit before the faccts

I can pick out facts thatt i wantt to put in there - butt i can organize how i want

Three sets of facts

Come up with 3 clumps/sets of facts (specific events) you think it is important the affidavit describe (facts connected to proving or disproving neglect) there may be more – this is just brainstorming

- COVID: took care of kids in scary time. Luisa asked Nadine to babysit and it was Nadine who broke it off not Luisa
o	Probably not good for her job if
- Nadine had left the kids on their own because she knew the mom was on her way home and she felt comfortable with them being alone
- Carmela went to a park when her mother was taking a nap so

Suggest an order of the events – can be chronological could be organized in some other fashion

Moved to New York
Pandemic
Luisa Russo lost job
Nadine babysit
Mom was ill

Suggest at least two sets of narrative facts that make the specific event facts more believable / or show how the affiant knows of the specific event facts
