<p>Under Section 1012 of the Family Court Act, a respondent parent may be responsible for neglect of a child if (1) the child’s physical, mental or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as a result of the failure of the parent to exercise a minimum degree of care, or (2) the parent fails to provide the child with proper supervision or guardianship by unreasonably inflicting or allowing to be inflicted harm or a substantial risk thereof. N.Y. Family Ct. Act § 1012 (f) (i), (f) (B).  There must be a link or causal connection between the basis for the neglect petition and the circumstances that allegedly produce the child’s impairment or imminent danger of impairment, including impairment to the child’s emotional or mental health or condition. Nicholson v. Scopetta 3 N.Y.3d 357 (2004), 370.</p>

<p>Look at John O to see what they chose to pull from Nicholson and where they decided to omiit.</p>

<p>How are the cases where the court finds neglect describing the rule, and how are the cases where the court finds no neglect describing the rule?</p>

<p>Look at neglect AND no neglect cases</p>
