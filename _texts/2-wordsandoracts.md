Three things we need for affidavit:

Harm or imminent harm
what type of harm potentially at isssue in matter of carmela R and Samuel R

Caused by / attributed to
Facts that may or may not support causation

Respondent's failure to exercise a minimum degree of care (FEMDOC)
What facts support that there was/was not FEMDOC

What do you have to do to blow it up? Disprove one of these things.

What harm was there? Broken arm. But there might be other things. We need to know what other things there might be that happened.

Path of an article 10 case

We're going to be at the petition filed stage - we're going to be writing a motion to dismiss.

There will be a motion to dismiss petition of neglect before we get to fact finding - we will be right before the 1027 box. We will be filing a motion to dismiss the ACS petition of neglect.

ARC of an article 10 case

removal is not an issue (although as with any neglect case removal can happen)

The child breaking the arm is one thing. If ACS goes in and sees other neglect that will  be brought in.

ASK WITNESS: have you seen these other types of neglect (examples of types of neglect from cases)

Determinations case by case

Witness interviews - ethical and practical requirements

What do the Rules of Professional Conduct require of you when speaking to the witness?

can you use this to help set the witness at ease? But also let thhem know who we are andd what we're doing. And we can use that to set them at ease. The more upffront we are about what we are looking for, hhow werre going to use info, whhat our goals are, thhe more they will be at ease.

Confidentiality - tell witnesss that we can't promise confidentiality. The affidavit may go to court.

How do I have them sign affidavit? Can go over it line by line in zoom. Ask is this correct, is this your address?

Should we record the interview? Should we ask if we can record the interview? We would be using the recording to transcribe note taking.

Valentine says that she would feel that the potential problems of data mining etc. would need to be explained to the interviewee.  

Witness may not have a good device. May not have a good connection.

Not sure what it is but seeing someone face to face seems to tell you a little bit more about that person.

There have been opinions regarding how to handle certain things via zoom.

What ethical issues might come up? Maybe before the interview begins we should explain our ethical obligations. We might use these ethical obligations to put them at ease.

How does zoom change an interview approach?

establishing rapport
answering questions about format
taking notes
asking for documents
preparing for her to review affidaavit after you draft itt at some future point?

attorney client privilege stops me from being forced to say in court what my client said to me. I can not say if the communiication meets some kind of criteria. must be private, for example

witness interview - witness info

purpose of iinccluding info about witness iin affidavit?

how might personal info about witness aid in making the information presented more or less persuasiive? Amsterdam's believability vs bias. It's important that i be able to tell the jury who the witness is I have to make what the wiitness is saying believable to the jury.

what personal info seems requirred as a bare minimum?

what things not directly about the Russo children or Luisa Russo and that re not pedigree (where she lives, how many feet down the hall) info might I ask about?

any past info with ACS personally - if so her feelings about?
others in building or elsewhere that might know family?
anything you havent asked that she thiinks is important
willingness to provide affidavit

start with case file - what does case file suggest is the main concern?

what does the rule for neglect from fcca and nicholson suggest in terrms of the types of events affecting the children or (in)actions by luisa russo that the witness should be asked about?

harm

what story is my affidavit going to tell - some idea before questioning witness

organize facts in affidavit to address aspects of rule/rule explanation (policy, definitions, examples, standards) of neglect.

Tonight, during breakout

Neglect questions

Pedigree questions
